# Math Magicians

> The React calculator app is a web-based application that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations with a responsive and dynamic user interface. The app is built with React components that allow users to input numeric values and mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The app's interface dynamically updates as users enter values and operators, and it provides instant feedback on the calculated result. The app also includes memory functionality, which allows users to save and recall previously calculated values.
The app is intended to be user-friendly and responsive, working seamlessly across a variety of devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It can handle a wide range of calculations, from simple arithmetic to complex scientific calculations.

### Features
- **Addition:** Perform addition of two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Perform subtraction of two numbers.
- **Multiplication:** Perform multiplication of two or more numbers.
- **Division:** Perform division of two numbers.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or calculations.

### Technologies Used

- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS:** Styling the calculator and providing a visually appealing interface.
